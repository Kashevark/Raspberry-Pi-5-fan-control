STEP1 = 48  
; Minimum temperature to activate fan at speed 1 (in °C)

STEP2 = 60

STEP3 = 65  
; Temperature threshold to switch to speed 3

STEP4 = 72  
; Temperature threshold for maximum (speed 4) cooling

SLEEP_TIMER = 1  
; Temperature check interval (in seconds)

TICKS = 15  
; Number of checks before updating fan speed (prevents rapid switching)
